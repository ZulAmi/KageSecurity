# KageSec

**A security scanner that actually finds things.** KageSec crawls your web app, throws 61 vulnerability modules at it, runs 7,400+ CVE templates via a purpose-built Go engine, and uses AI to verify whether the findings are real — so your report isn't 200 false positives that someone has to triage at 11pm.

Think of it as Nuclei and ZAP had a baby, the baby learned Python and Go, and then got really into AI and AppSec workflows.

## vs Nuclei CLI — Real Benchmark

Tested against [ginandjuice.shop](https://ginandjuice.shop) (PortSwigger's intentionally vulnerable app), same template directory (`~/.kagesec/nuclei-templates`), same concurrency (50):

| | KageSec (no AI, no browser) | Nuclei CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **Total scan time** | **29m 36s** | **5m 22s** |
| Pages / URLs scanned | 31 pages crawled | 1 URL |
| Templates run | 7,417 HTTP templates | 9,028 templates |
| Template findings | 24 | 25 |
| **Total findings** | **50** | **25** |
| **False positives** | **0** | unknown |
| OS Command Injection | ✅ CRITICAL | ❌ |
| Server-Side Template Injection | ✅ CRITICAL | ❌ |
| Client-Side Template Injection | ✅ CRITICAL | ❌ |
| DOM-Based XSS | ✅ HIGH | ❌ |
| Reflected XSS | ✅ HIGH | ❌ |
| Insecure Direct Object Reference | ✅ HIGH | ❌ |
| Blind XSS | ✅ HIGH | ❌ |
| SSI Injection | ✅ HIGH | ❌ |
| CSRF | ✅ MEDIUM | ❌ |
| Business Logic flaws | ✅ MEDIUM | ❌ |
| Hidden paths (/admin 403) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Subdomain discovery | ✅ | ❌ |
| Nuclei's 25 findings | ✅ (24 matched) | ✅ |

**KageSec takes longer because it does more.** Nuclei fires templates at one URL and stops. KageSec crawls 31 pages, runs exploitation modules per page, and runs the template engine concurrently — the template engine itself finishes in ~2 minutes. The extra time is spent finding the vulnerabilities Nuclei structurally cannot find: SSTI, DOM XSS, IDOR, business logic, CSRF.

The 50 findings are all real. Parameter discovery false positives — the classic DAST noise problem — are eliminated by a canary-based comparison baseline (the same approach used by Burp Param Miner and Arjun).

## Why this exists

I paid a security firm thousands of dollars to do a penetration test for my startup. Fair enough — you need a PTAA report, compliance asks for it, I get it.

Then, at the end of the engagement, the same firm casually mentioned they also offer an _automated DAST scanning service_. Ongoing. Recurring. Thousands of dollars a year. For a tool that runs automatically.

I sat with that for a moment.

I know Nuclei exists. It's great. It's the industry open-source standard and ProjectDiscovery has built something genuinely impressive. But the companies built on top of it will happily charge you enterprise pricing for what is, at its core, a YAML template runner with a nice UI.

So I built KageSec instead — open-source, AI-powered, and free. It runs the same categories of checks, uses Nuclei-compatible templates, and adds AI on top to verify whether findings are actually exploitable.

Zero subscription fees. Zero per-seat pricing. Zero "contact us for enterprise". Just clone it and run it.

---

## Go Template Engine

KageSec ships `kagesec-engine` — a purpose-built Go binary that handles the template execution phase. It is not a wrapper around Nuclei. It is a replacement.

### Why not just use Nuclei?

| Feature | Nuclei | kagesec-engine |
|---|---|---|
| Template selection | Tag filters only | Fingerprints the target stack, runs most relevant templates first |
| False positive scoring | Binary match / no-match | Confidence score 0.0–1.0 per finding |
| OOB templates | Creates findings on injection | Skipped — no unconfirmed false positives without a real callback listener |
| Output | JSON files or stdout | JSON Lines streamed in real-time — Python reads findings as they arrive |
| Auth context | Limited | Inherits all KageSec headers, cookies, and bearer tokens |
| Template coverage | 9,028 (incl. flow/js/code) | 7,417 HTTP templates — flow/javascript/code templates not yet supported |
| AI filtering | None | With API key, Claude narrows 7,400+ templates to 80-200 relevant ones |

In benchmark testing: **7,417 HTTP templates in ~2 minutes** with 50 goroutines. Nuclei ran 9,028 templates in 5m 22s as a standalone scan — both matched ~25 findings from the same template set.

### Building the engine

**pip install users:** The binary is already bundled — nothing to build.

If you cloned the repo or want to rebuild:

```bash
# Requires Go 1.22+
cd engine
go build -o kagesec-engine .
```

### Cross-compiling for CI / Docker

```bash
# Linux (for Docker/CI)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o kagesec-engine-linux-amd64 .

# Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o kagesec-engine-windows-amd64.exe .
```

## Claude Code Users

If you use Claude Code to build and deploy your apps, KageSec plugs in directly.

**Option 1 — Ask Claude to scan during a conversation:**

Once you add KageSec as an MCP server (see [Claude Code Integration](#claude-code-integration) below), you can just tell Claude:

> _"Scan this for security issues"_ or _"Deploy it and then run a security scan"_

Claude will call `kagesec_scan()` as a tool and report findings back in the conversation.

**Option 2 — Automatic scan on every deployment:**

The `.claude/` folder includes a hook that fires after any deployment Bash command (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, Railway, Fly.io, AWS, etc.). Claude detects the live URL from the deployment output and starts a background scan automatically. Check `reports/` when it's done.

---

## What it does

- **61 vulnerability modules** — XSS, SQLi, SSRF, SSTI, XXE, deserialization, request smuggling, prototype pollution, JWT attacks, and more. If it's in the OWASP Top 10, there's a module for it.
- **Go template engine** — `kagesec-engine` runs 7,417 HTTP-compatible Nuclei templates with 50 goroutines, real-time streaming, and confidence scoring. ~2 minutes for 7,417 templates. With an AI key, Claude narrows templates to 80-200 relevant ones for your stack.
- **5 AI providers** — Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini, Mistral, and Ollama (local, no key required). Auto-detected from environment variables. If none are configured, an interactive menu prompts you at startup (skipped in CI/non-TTY environments).
- **Zero false positives in parameter discovery** — canary-based comparison baseline matches the approach used by Burp Param Miner and Arjun. Two-tier wordlist (security-critical vs medium-confidence) with per-param attempt tracking.
- **Finding state tracking** — every scan compares against the previous scan. Findings are classified as `NEW`, `REPEATED`, `REGRESSED` (was fixed, broke again), or `RESOLVED` (fixed since last scan). Modelled on Burp Enterprise's issue tracking.
- **"Fix These First" prioritization** — after each scan, findings are scored by CVSS + AI exploitability verdict + finding state + severity tier and ranked. No more "here are 50 findings, good luck." Modelled on Bright Security's two-lens approach.
- **Scheduled scanning** — `kagesec schedule add <target> --interval daily` — saves to `~/.kagesec/schedules.yaml`, runs via `kagesec schedule run` from crontab or CI.
- **Session expiry detection** — `--login-logged-out REGEX` and `--login-logged-in REGEX` check every page response to detect expired sessions and re-authenticate mid-scan. Mirrors StackHawk's `loggedInIndicator`/`loggedOutIndicator` and ZAP's auth verification strategy.
- **Headless browser crawling** — Playwright handles SPAs and JS-heavy apps. Enabled by default.
- **Full auth support** — Bearer tokens, cookies, OAuth2, multi-step logins, TOTP 2FA, session expiry re-auth.
- **API scanning** — OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP/WSDL, HAR import.
- **6 report formats** — JSON, Markdown, PDF, SARIF, Burp XML, ZAP JSON — all saved to `reports/`.
- **Compliance mapping** — ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, APPI.
- **CI/CD native** — GitHub Actions, `--fail-on high`, SARIF upload. Break the build before the attacker breaks your users.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic scan — finds stuff, saves reports to reports/
kagesec scan https://target.example.com

# With AI verification (highly recommended — cuts false positives, scores exploitability)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... kagesec scan https://target.example.com --output all

# Zero-cost AI with Ollama (local model, no API key)
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --output all

# Disable browser for a faster, lighter scan
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --no-browser

# Only care about specific vulnerabilities?
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --modules xss sqli ssrf

# Scan multiple targets at once
kagesec scan --targets urls.txt --parallel 5 --output sarif

# Passive mode — look but don't touch
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --passive

# Slow and sneaky (useful if the target has a WAF)
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile stealth --rate-limit 2

# Through Burp for manual review alongside
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Add a custom header to every request
kagesec scan https://target.example.com -H "X-Api-Key: abc123" -H "X-Tenant: staging"

# Tune SQLi payloads for a known database
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --dbms postgres --risk 2

# Prevent Mac from sleeping during long scans
caffeinate -i kagesec scan https://target.example.com --nuclei-templates --stats
```

---

## AI Providers

KageSec supports 5 AI providers. It auto-detects whichever one you have configured via environment variables — no flags needed.

```bash
# Anthropic Claude (recommended — best verification quality)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# OpenAI GPT-4o
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Google Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# Mistral
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=...

# Ollama — local model, zero cost, no key needed
# Just make sure Ollama is running: https://ollama.com
export OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434   # optional, this is the default
```

**Priority:** Anthropic → OpenAI → Gemini → Mistral → Ollama.

If no key is detected and stdin is a TTY, an interactive menu appears at startup:

```
[?] No AI key detected.
    AI verification cuts false positives, scores exploitability,
    and writes a human-readable report. Select a provider:

    1. Anthropic Claude  —  claude.ai/settings — recommended
    2. OpenAI GPT-4o     —  platform.openai.com/api-keys
    3. Google Gemini     —  aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
    4. Mistral Large     —  console.mistral.ai
    5. Ollama (local)    —  no key needed — runs on your machine
    6. Skip — run without AI
```

In CI/non-TTY environments the menu is skipped automatically and the scan runs without AI.

Override the model explicitly with `--ai-model`:

```bash
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --ai-model gemini-1.5-pro
```

If no AI provider is available, the scan still runs all 61 modules and produces full findings — you just won't get the AI triage layer or the narrative Markdown report.

AI verification batches findings in groups of 10, classifies each as `true_positive`, `false_positive`, or `needs_manual_review`, and scores exploitability and business impact.

---

## Authentication

KageSec can log into your app before scanning — including detecting when the session expires mid-scan and re-authenticating automatically.

```bash
# Bearer token
kagesec scan https://api.example.com --auth-bearer eyJhbGc...

# Session cookie
kagesec scan https://app.example.com --auth-cookie "session=abc123"

# Netscape-format cookie jar (exported from browser DevTools or curl)
kagesec scan https://app.example.com --cookie-jar ./cookies.txt

# OAuth2 client credentials
kagesec scan https://api.example.com \
  --auth-oauth2-token-url https://auth.example.com/token \
  --auth-oauth2-client-id my-client \
  --auth-oauth2-client-secret my-secret

# Multi-step browser login (clicks the form like a human)
kagesec scan https://app.example.com \
  --login-url https://app.example.com/login \
  --login-user-selector "#email" \
  --login-pass-selector "#password" \
  --login-submit-selector "button[type=submit]" \
  --login-username admin@example.com \
  --login-password secret \
  --login-success "/dashboard"

# 2FA with TOTP
kagesec scan https://app.example.com \
  --login-url https://app.example.com/login \
  --login-username admin@example.com \
  --login-password secret \
  --login-totp-secret JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP

# Session expiry detection — re-authenticates mid-scan if the session drops
# (mirrors StackHawk loggedInIndicator/loggedOutIndicator + ZAP auth verification)
kagesec scan https://app.example.com \
  --login-url https://app.example.com/login \
  --login-username admin@example.com \
  --login-password secret \
  --login-success "/dashboard" \
  --login-logged-out "Sign in to your account|Session expired" \
  --login-logged-in "My Account|Welcome back" \
  --login-session-check https://app.example.com/account
```

**`--login-logged-out REGEX`** — regex matched against every page response body. If it fires (e.g. login form reappeared), the scanner re-authenticates before continuing.

**`--login-logged-in REGEX`** — regex that must be present in the response body to confirm a valid session. If absent, re-authenticate.

**`--login-session-check URL`** — a known-authenticated URL polled every 50 module runs to check session validity. If omitted, every crawled page is checked instead.

---

## Finding States & Prioritization

Every scan compares its findings against the previous scan for the same target. Findings appear in the output with state badges:

```
[+] Finding states: NEW 3 | REPEATED 18 | REGRESSED 1
[+] Resolved since last scan: 5 finding(s) fixed
    ✓ Missing CSP Header — https://example.com
    ✓ Clickjacking — https://example.com
    ...
```

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NEW` | First time this finding appeared on this target |
| `REPEATED` | Present in both the previous scan and this one — still not fixed |
| `REGRESSED` | Was resolved in a previous scan, now reappeared — needs urgent attention |
| `RESOLVED` | Was present before, no longer detected — fix confirmed |

After every scan, KageSec outputs a **Fix These First** section — findings ranked by priority score (CVSS + AI exploitability verdict + state bonus):

```
── FIX THESE FIRST ───────────────────────────────────────────
   1. [score 16.3] CRITICAL [NEW]       OS Command Injection
                   https://target.com/catalog  param=searchTerm
   2. [score 15.3] CRITICAL [REPEATED]  Client-Side Template Injection
                   https://target.com/catalog  param=searchTerm
   3. [score 14.3] HIGH     [REGRESSED] XSS — was fixed, broke again
                   https://target.com/search  param=q
   ...top 10 only...
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Scoring: CVSS base (0–10) + AI true_positive (+3) + OOB verified (+2) + severity tier + REGRESSED bonus (+2.5).

---

## Scheduled Scanning

```bash
# Add a nightly scan
kagesec schedule add https://app.example.com --interval daily --level 3 --max-pages 150

# Weekly scan with a specific profile
kagesec schedule add https://app.example.com --interval weekly --profile full

# Cron expression
kagesec schedule add https://app.example.com --interval "0 2 * * *"

# List all schedules with next-run times
kagesec schedule list

# Remove a schedule
kagesec schedule remove https://app.example.com

# Run all due schedules (call this from system crontab or a nightly CI step)
kagesec schedule run
```

Schedules are stored in `~/.kagesec/schedules.yaml`. No daemon required — add `kagesec schedule run` to your crontab:

```bash
0 2 * * * kagesec schedule run
```

---

## Retesting Findings

After a fix is deployed, verify it without running the full scan:

```bash
# By index (0-based)
kagesec retest 0 --report reports/kagesec_report.json

# By title substring
kagesec retest "OS Command" --report reports/kagesec_report.json
kagesec retest "XSS" --report reports/kagesec_report.json
```

The retest first tries to replay the exact HTTP request from the `poc_curl` field (< 2s). If that's inconclusive, it re-runs the relevant detection module. Reports `STILL PRESENT` or `RESOLVED`.

---

## API & Protocol Scanning

```bash
# OpenAPI / Swagger (URL or local file)
kagesec scan https://api.example.com --openapi https://api.example.com/openapi.json

# GraphQL
kagesec scan https://api.example.com --graphql https://api.example.com/graphql

# gRPC
kagesec scan grpc://api.example.com:50051 --grpc api.example.com:50051

# SOAP / WSDL
kagesec scan https://api.example.com --wsdl https://api.example.com/service?wsdl

# Import a HAR file (great for scanning authenticated flows recorded in Chrome DevTools)
kagesec scan https://app.example.com --har ./session.har
```

---

## Scan Workflows

Workflows chain scan steps with conditions — useful for parameterized scans or target-specific playbooks.

```bash
# Run a built-in workflow
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --workflow quick-web
kagesec scan https://wordpress.example.com --workflow wordpress

# List available workflows
kagesec workflows

# Use a custom workflow YAML
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --workflow ~/.kagesec/workflows/my-playbook.yaml
```

Custom workflows live in `~/.kagesec/workflows/` or can be referenced by file path.

---

## Claude Code Integration

### Option 1 — MCP Server

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kagesec": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "scanner.mcp_server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/KageSec"
    }
  }
}
```

Now Claude can call `kagesec_scan("https://your-app.com")` directly inside a conversation.

### Option 2 — PostToolUse Hook

The `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/post_deploy_scan.py` files are already included. When Claude runs a deployment command, the hook extracts the live URL and kicks off a background scan automatically.

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: KageSec Security Scan
        uses: ZulAmi/KageSecurity@main
        with:
          target: https://staging.example.com
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          fail-on: high
          output: sarif

      - name: Upload to GitHub Security tab
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: reports/kagesec_report.sarif
```

Full examples in the [`ci/`](ci/) folder.

### Break the build on real findings

```bash
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --fail-on high
```

Exit code `1` if findings at or above the specified severity are found; `0` if clean.

### GitHub Actions environment variables

The `action.yml` composite action sets `KAGESEC_*` variables that override CLI flags — useful for CI-specific behaviour without changing the command line:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `KAGESEC_NO_AI=1` | Disable AI verification |
| `KAGESEC_PASSIVE=1` | Switch to passive mode |
| `KAGESEC_MODULES="xss sqli"` | Restrict to these modules |
| `KAGESEC_EXCLUDE="*/logout*"` | Skip URL patterns |

### Delta Scanning

KageSec remembers which pages it already scanned. Unchanged pages get skipped on repeat runs — CI scans get faster over time. Use `--full` to force a complete rescan.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Scan Profiles

```bash
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile quick      # Fast, low noise — good for CI
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile full       # Everything, max depth
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile api        # API-focused
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile passive    # Look, don't touch
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --profile stealth    # Low and slow, random User-Agent
```

### Resume Interrupted Scans

```bash
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --resume <scan-id>
```

### Scan History & Trends

```bash
kagesec history https://target.example.com             # Summary with state breakdown
kagesec history https://target.example.com --scans     # All past scans
kagesec history https://target.example.com --persisting # Findings seen in multiple scans
```

### Suppress False Positives

```bash
kagesec suppress add --title "User Name Information"   # Suppress OSINT noise
kagesec suppress add --title "RDAP WHOIS"
kagesec suppress list
kagesec suppress remove <id>
```

### Custom Plugins

```python
# ~/.kagesec/plugins/my_check.py
from scanner.core.scan_result import Finding, Severity

def test(page, client, **kwargs):
    if "X-Custom-Header" not in page.headers:
        return [Finding(
            title="Missing X-Custom-Header",
            severity=Severity.LOW,
            url=page.url,
        )]
    return []
```

### Out-of-Band (Blind) Detection

```bash
# Disable for air-gapped targets
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --no-oob

# Use your own callback domain
kagesec scan https://target.example.com --oob-server callbacks.internal.example.com
```

### Notifications

```bash
kagesec scan https://target.example.com \
  --notify-slack https://hooks.slack.com/... \
  --notify-min-severity high
```

Supports Slack, Teams, Discord, and generic JSON webhooks.

No AI key? KageSec runs all 61 modules and produces full reports without one. You just won't get the AI triage layer or the narrative Markdown report.

## Contributing

This project is, and probably always will be, a work in progress. There's always another module to write, another CVE to template, another compliance control to map, or another edge case in a web framework that breaks everything in a fun new way.

If you want to work on it — security researcher, developer who found a bug, someone who wants to add a module, or someone who paid too much for a PTAA and wants to commiserate — reach out.
